Description: Educational package for Advanced R Lab 3. Implements
    'euclidean(a, b)' for the greatest common divisor (Euclidean algorithm)
    and 'dijkstra(graph, init_node)' for single-source shortest paths on
    non-negative weighted graphs. Includes the 'wiki_graph' example dataset
    and tests.
